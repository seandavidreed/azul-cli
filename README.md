#### Purpose
This is a simple command line implementation of the board game [Azul](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul). I created it to sharpen my Python skills and to practice coding game logic.

#### How to Play
```
git clone https://www.github.com/seandavidreed/azul-cli.git
cd azul-cli
python3 runner.py --players=2
```

The game supports 2-4 players and you can specify your number of players with the `--players=#` flag.
